General tips for writing
========================

Flow
----

It should be clear how each sentence and paragraph relates to **the adjacent ones**.

Rule1:

1. **Begin sentences with old information.** Create a link to earlier text.
2. **End sentences with new information.** Create a link to the text that follows, also places new info in the position of emphasis.

Coherence
---------

It should be clear how each sentence and paragraph relates to the big picture.

Rule2:

**One paragraph, one point**.

1. A paragraph should have one main point, expressed in a single **point sentence**.
2. **Typically**, the point sentence should appear **at or near the beginning of the paragraph**.

--------------

Rule3:

**Give unique names to things and use them consistently**.

Just in time
------------

Rule4:

**Give information precisely when it is needed, not before**.

Structure of a research paper
=============================

The basic idea: TOP-DOWN.

Explain your work at multiple levels of abstraction starting at a high level and getting progressively more detailed. A typical structure is:

1. Abstract (1-2 paragraphs, 1000 readers)
2. Intro (1-2 pages, 100 readers)
3. Key ideas (2-3 pages, 50 readers)
4. Technical meat (4-6 pages, 5 readers)
5. Related work (1-2 pages, 100 readers)

Abstract
--------

The CGI model for an abstract/intro.

Context
~~~~~~~

Set the stage, motivate the general topic.

Gap
~~~

Explain your specific problem and why existing work does not adequately solve it.

Innovation
~~~~~~~~~~

State what you've done that is new and explain how it helps fill the gap.

Introduction
------------

There are two ways in writing the introduction.

1. Like an expanded version of the abstract.
2. Eliminate **C** ontext. 
   For example: 1. Start with a concrete example. 2. If this works, it can be effective, but I find it often doesn't work.

In the second way, it assumes the reader already knows the context.

Key ideas
---------

1. Use **concrete illustrative** examples and **high-level** intuition.
2. You do not have to show the general solution. (That's what the technical section is for).

Why have a "key ideas" section at all?

1. Force you to have a "takeaway".
2. Many readers only care about the takeaway, not the technical details.
3. For those who want the technical details, the key ideas are still useful as "scaffolding".

Related work
------------

**It goes at the end** of the paper. You can only properly compare to related work once you've explained your own.

**Give real comparisons**, not a "laundry list"! Explain in detail how your work fills the **Gap** in a way that related work doesn't.
